## How to Play with Others
It's quite simple actually, theres only two things you have to do in game.

### FTB Party
1. Create a FTB Party: GUI found in the top left of inventory screen (3 people button)
2. Invite your friends to the party: `/ftbteams party invite [player]`
3. Accept the invite: `/ftbteams party accept [player]`

Doing this will sync your quest progress and create a party chat.

### Land Claiming 
1. Have a section of land claimed. (Learn how to claim land [here](https://wiki.fluxsmp.com/create-astral/land-claiming))
2. Add your friends to your claim: `/flan group players add Co-Owner [player]`

That's it! You can now play with your friends and share your progress.

### Useful Commands
- `/tpa [player]` - Teleport to a player
- `/tpahere [player]` - Teleport a player to you
- `/home` - Teleport / Set a home
