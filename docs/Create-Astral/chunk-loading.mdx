## Chunk Loading Information
In this pack, chunk loading is a donator only perk. This is due to the performance impact of loading chunks and the lack of a way to prevent players from abusing the system. You recieve chunk loaders by purchasing a rank or donating to the server on our [store](https://store.fluxsmp.com/).

## Chunk Loading Rules and Restrictions
* Chunk loaders are in the form of the "Chunk Loader" block from tech reborn. This block is not craftable and can load one chunk at a time.
* Chunk loaders only load when the player is online. If you are offline, the chunk will be loaded for 30 minutes before unloading.
* Using alternative methods of chunkloading is not allowed and will likely result in punishment. Please bring it to a staff member's attention if you are unsure.
