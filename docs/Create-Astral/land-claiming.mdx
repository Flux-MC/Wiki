## How to Claim Land
The easiest way to claim land is by using a golden hoe and right click opposite corners of the area you would like to claim. You can also use the command `/flan addClaim` to claim land.

## How to resize your claim
You can do this by getting a golden hoe and right clicking a corner of your claim then right clicking the new corner you would like to resize to. You can also just remove your claim and restart.

## How to adjust claim permissions
While inside your claim you can use the command `/flan menu` to open the claim menu. From there you can adjust permissions for your claim. Within this menu you can customize group permissions. To add someone to a group you can use the command" `/flan group players add [group] [player].` You can also use the menu.

## How to remove a claim 
You can delete a claim using `/flan menu`. 

## Sub Claims
A subclaim is a claim inside a claim. Subclaims have their own permission and group sets that override the parent claim they are in (no you cannot create a subclaim inside a subclaim). Subclaim permissions have an additional value "default" instead of just true and false which simply redirects that permission back to the parent claim. To create a subclaim switch to subclaim mode via /flan switchMode. Then use your claiming tool the same way you create a normal claim. Opening the subclaim menu and editing subclaim permissions requires you to be in subclaim mode too.
