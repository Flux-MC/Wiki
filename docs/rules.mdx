## Staff may moderate at their discretion

These rules may not cover everything. Staff hold the right to moderate anything that seems inappropriate for the community / servers. Please use common sense. We know it’s almost a super power, but we believe in you <3.

## Support

-   Support from staff members is limited to interactions with the hosted pack and with elements of the discord service (bots, etc.). We expect a degree of self-support when using Minecraft mod packs, and cannot have staff provide extensive support outside of the interactions with the server. You may use the community support channel for these types of issues.
-   If you have any questions about gameplay, google it. You may also use general channels to ask other members of the community.
-   Limit pinging staff members to a single notification. Make use of the staff groups where possible. We are usually pretty quick to respond unless we are busy. We will see it.
-   Do not direct message staff members; use the ticket system or a single ping in channel.

> **Offenses:**

> **First:** Warning

> **Second:** Warning

> **Subsequent:** Staff’s Discretion ( Warning / Temp Ban / Ban )

## General Behavior

> **Offences:**

-   If you are in a voice chat with people who do not have microphones please be actively looking at the relevant chat so that they may participate.

> **Offenses:**

## Minecraft Rules

----------

## Age Requirements

**Public Servers:** 14+ (Unless accompanied by an verified adult)

**Private / Invite only Servers:** Depends on the server

## PVP

Unless the server is oriented to pvping, this is NOT allowed. The only exception is that if both parties clearly agree to it. An easy way to make it clear to staff is to type in chat: “pvp”.

> **Offences:**

> **First:** Warning

> **Second:** Temp Ban

> **Third:** Permanent Ban

## Land Claiming

-   Respect people’s claims / space. Do not touch what isn’t yours, even if not claimed.
-   Claim all of your builds.
-   Do not claim land near other claims. ‘Near’ is subjective and if you have any concerns your build may be too close by please check with a mod.
-   Do NOT claim any public areas (Spawns, Main End Island, Community Areas, Popular Nether Fortresses, etc)
-   Only claim what you need. Don’t claim unnecessary amounts of land or land that you will never use.

> **Offences:**

> **First:** Warning

> **Subsequent:** Staff’s Discretion ( Warning / Temp Ban / Ban )

  

## Chunk Loading

-   Chunk loading is dependent on the pack and the tools made available, but primarily is a donation benefit due to the impact it has on server performance. Please check the #info channel of the server you are playing on.
-   Do not use alternative methods of chunk loading. Using these can result in punishment depending on the server’s specific rules.

> **Offenses:**

> **First:** Warning + Removal

> **Subsequent:** Staff’s Discretion ( Warning / Temp Ban / Ban )

## AFK Rules

These rules vary depending on the server. Generally you AFKing has a high lag impact on the server you should refrain from it. Each server will have more specific rules listed. If AFKing on a server is not allowed or you are bypassing the rules, the punishments are as follows.

> **Offences:**

> **First:** Warning

> **Subsequent:** Staff’s Discretion ( Warning / Temp Ban / Ban )

## Exploiting

The use of exploits is heavily dependent on the pack. This also includes command / rank perk exploits. As a general rule of thumb, create a ticket and report the exploit to see if you are allowed to use it. If you are given the okay, it’s fine. If not and you are caught abusing it then you will be punished.

> **Offenses:**

> **First:** Warning + Removal of Items given by exploit.

> **Subsequent:** Staff’s Discretion ( Warning / Temp Ban / Ban ) + Removal of Items

## Cheating

Cheating is never allowed and will not be tolerated. There should be absolutely no need to cheat.

> **Offenses:**

> **First:** Permanent Ban

## Griefing

Griefing is never allowed on the servers. Punishment is up to staff’s Discretion, however most of the time leads to a ban.

> Offenses:

> **First:** ( Temp Ban / Ban )  
> **Second:** Permanent Ban

## Trolling

Trolling in generally not allowed. The only exception is if both parties explicitly agree to it by typing in chat: “I agree to trolling with (player's name)”.

> **Offences:**

> **First:** Warning

> **Subsequent:** Staff’s Discretion ( Warning / Temp Ban / Ban )

## Building

-   Always build with understanding that you are collaborating on a shared space. Do not allow items to overflow into the world; especially with regards to mob farms. Ensure your loot pickup systems have entity voiding in mind.
-   The number one priority of the server is reducing lag - a laggy server is no fun for anyone. It is assumed that all players will build with this priority in mind; do not build anything which produces lag needlessly - farms that are not required to exist should be dismantled, overflow of items must be handled (void upgrades, or auto-shut off). Collaboration with other players to avoid building multiple versions of the same machine/farm are encouraged.
-   All builds that create large amounts of entities need to have a overflow system built.
-   Any builds causing substantial lag to a server will result in staff action. Each build generally will have it’s own warnings. However if it becomes a common occurrence, the warnings will start to stack.

> **Offenses:**

> **First:** Warning + Told how to fix it.

> **Second:** Final Warning

> **Third:** Removal of Laggy Build + No Refund

> **Subsequent:** Staff’s Discretion ( Warning / Temp Ban / Ban )

## Build Decay

If you are absent from the server for an extended period of time (without notice) we reserve the right to remove / repurpose anything within your claims. This includes builds, farms, etc.

## Evading Punishments / Limits

The use of alternative accounts to evade punishments or bypass server restrictions such as chunk loading or claiming limits is prohibited. Alternate accounts for other reasons are allowed, however they must be declared to a staff member.

## Item Refunds

We are pretty forgiving when it comes to item refunds. If items are lost due to the server or staff we will refund your items every time. If it is 100% the player’s fault, it will be refunded with no issues for the first time. Any time after that it is up to the staff’s discretion.

----------

# Final Notice

-   All these rules are subject to change. Even if a rule is not listed, it doesn't mean it doesn't apply. Use common sense.
-   Staff have final say.
