### Minecraft Server Rules:

:::note Please Note
Discord Rules also apply within the servers.
:::

- Age requirement depends on the server (see information entries);
- Do no claim public areas. This includes the main end island, spawn, and other structures or areas near spawn (500x500);
- No hacking, exploiting, griefing, stealing, scamming, begging or nagging;
- Trolling is never allowed unless publicly posted that both participants agree and understand the possible outcomes;
- Please do not AFK on the servers;
- Please build with server performance in mind. The more people do this, the longer the world will last. If you build something that causes a lot of lag on a server, expect it to be removed;
- Respect other players' space. Do not touch what isn't yours, even if not claimed;
- Only ask moderators and admins for help when it comes to a server;
- No item refunds unless caused by a team member or a server issue.


#### All these rules are subject to change. Even if a rule is not listed, it does not mean it doesn't apply. Use common sense.

#### Staff have the final say.
