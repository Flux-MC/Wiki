# Getting Started
---

## Solo
Once you enter the server, you can enter the portal on the spawn ship. You can then select a starter island and start your journey.

## Team
Create a FTB Party by entering your inventory and clicking on the three people icon in the top left. You can then invite your friends to your party. Once you have a party, you can enter the portal on the spawn ship. You can then select a starter island and start your journey. 
If you have someone joining after you have already started, you can invite them to your party and then they can do `/ftbdim home` to teleport to your team's island.

:::tip Useful Commands
`/ftbdim home` - Teleports you to your team's island.

`/tpa <player>` - Sends a teleport request to a player.

`/ftbdim lobby` - Teleports you to spawn.
